Twenty years ago ritin by
James Campbell

I have wandered to the village tom I leve
Sat beneath the tree upon the school
house playing ground which sheltered
you and me but none are laft to greet
me tom and few are left to [[illegible]] that
played with us upon the green Just twenty
year ago

the grass is Jist as green dear tom bare
footed days at play are sporting just as we were
then with spirits jist as gay but master
sleeps upon the hill all coated over with
snow that afforded us a sliding plase jist twenty
years ago

The old school-house is altered some the benches
are replaced by new ones very like the same
our penknives had defaced but the same old
bricks in the wall the bell swings to and
fro the music jist the same dear Tom was
Twenty years ago

the boys are playing some old game beneath that
same old tree I do forget the name jist now you
have played the same with me on that same spot twas
played with knives by throwing so and so the leaders
had a task to do there twenty years ago

[[Page 2]]

the river is runing jist as still the willows
on its side are larger then they were dear
tom the stream appears less wide the
greapvine swing is ruined now where once
we played the beau and swung our sweet
hearts pretty girls jist twinty years ago

the spring that bubbled near the hill close by
the spreading beach is very
high twas once so low that we could almost
rich but in kneeling down to get a drink
dear tom I started so to see how sadly I
am changed since twinty years ago

down by the spring upon [[unclear]] you know
I cut your name your sweet hearts jist
beneath it tom and you did mine the
same some heartless wretch hes peeled the bark
twas dying sure but slow jist as the one
whose name you cut did twinty years ago

my lids have long been dry dear Tom
but tears come in my eyes I thought
of hir I loved so well those early
broken ties I visited the old churchyard
and took some flowers to strew upon the
graves of those we loved some twenty years ago

[[Page 3]]

some are in the churchyard laid some
sleep beneath the sea but few are
laft of our old class excepting you
and me but whan our time shall come
dear Tom and we are calld to go I hope
theyΓÇÖll lay us were we playd jist
twinty year ago

I heave not got a latter from you
since Mr mardo had laft there but I
will keep writing to yo maby I
will gat one [[unclear]] and it will
give me all the news at one
time but I wood rather gat
them oftener and I wood be
better satified to hear from you
every day then to hear from you
but once a month pleas give
my love to mother cansedie and
femely and all my friends in that
country and keep apart for your salf and

loving friend till daith James Campbell

to find you in good Health as this
leaves us all at present thank god
for all His mercies to us Dr brother
I received A long wished for letter
the 20th of November last dated the 4th
of october I answered your letter
about 1rst of December and I recied
no letter I am sending you 2 letters
now by emigrants going to New
York I Have given you a great
deal of information About this
poor misirable country But
I am not able for to let you
know the misery of it half as
Bad as it is all for the want of
money and the tyranny of
land lords and Bailiff and
poor rate collectors there is Plenty
of provision this year if there was
Any money for to buy it but
Poor Ireland is drained out that
there is not one penny in it

[[Page 4]]

By every sort of Bailiffs that is going
Here for there is scarsce one day
But there is New Bailiff I mentioned
to you in the other two letters
about Brother Neal it is two long
a subject to mention all about
Him in this letter but I will let
you know what part he is in
He is in lower Canada in a place
called St Anns it is in a collage
that he is as professor he is got
ordained there I mentioned his
passages to you in the other 2 letters
so I think it two tedious to mention
all to you in this Likewise
I mentioned to you in them the
Death in the family And Rose
was the first she died october 1rst
1831 your mother December 3rd 1837
your father May 1rst 1847 Uncle
Peter May 18th 1847 Br Micheal
June 18th 1847 Brother Peters
wife is allso 7 or 8 years He is
got married to the second wife
He had 6 small orphants by

[[Page 5]]

the first wife and he has a second
family by this wife Dr Brother you
wished to have some of your friends
there but the case is in short that
they are not able to reach your
length with their familys unless
you assist them they all have
some land property but there
is No value for land here now
since the loss of the potatoe came
on if a man is seaking his pleace
he may step off and leave it there
for there is not a man to give
him any thing for it in the commencement
of the Bad times I myself
was foolish enough to buy
Uncle Peters farm of land at odds
of 30┬ú sterling which I would get
a better farm this Day with out
one shilling only pay the for it
by purchase in the land and what
Neal cost me it has left me
Bear and Busy at this present
time for the rates and taxes would
be rent enough for the land if
the land lord would ask no rent
for it at all since the loss of the

[[Page 6]]

Potatoe crop has come on and the
lands was never high rated untill
that Dr brother I hope that you
will assist your friends if in
your power for if the times would
change the would get something
for their lands better than raise
up and it there at this present
time you mentioned in your
letter that you intend to come
to Ireland in a year or two if it
would answer you to come I think
it would be the best way and
then such as you think would [[test?]]
that country to bring them
and such as would not leave
them at home Dr brother I hope
if any of those 3 letters comes
to hand that you will not neglect
answering them as soon as possible
and if in your power
you will send some presents
to your friends that will carry
there on for they all say that
would go there if they able to
My paper is done I am your
Brother until Death James Campbell

My Dr Brother I take this opportunity
of writing those few lines to you Hoping
to find you in good Health as this
Leaves us all at Present thank god for
all His mercies to us My dr Brother
I riceieved your Long wished for Letter
which I never expected to Hear from
you Dr Brother I Have to inform you
that your Ant Rose departed this life
october 1rst 1831 your mother departed
this life December 3rd 1837 your
father departed May 1rst 1847 uncle
Peter May 25th 1847 Brother Micheal
June 26th 1847 that is what deaths
was in the family with the exception
of Brother Peters wife she died by
a severe fever in March 1841 My Dr
Brother I have to inform you that
no tongue can Explain to you the
misery of this country these 3 years
past since the last the potatoe crop for
the are all in the way of starvation for
any Man that is striving to hold on their
land if the have any thing there is not
one day in life but there is a new Bailif
with him either for rent or poor rates.
have 3 years before the bad times came
are the leases fell and we were all raised
in the rent And then the poor rates came
on so high as 7s 6d to the Pound rent so
that there is not one in 100 fit to bare
it all for the want of money if there was
any means of making any Money for
to pay those rents and takes the poor for
men aught strive to live what we used
to pay rent with here before this was
by butter and hogs but this year there
is not any thing for butter or hogs

[[Page 4]]

or cows if A man had any of them to spair but it
is few in number has any caves at all or any
thing else to spare the Agents and their Bailiffs
is takeing their small grains of oats and barley
with their and auctioning it and leaveing
the poor farmer to starve him self And His
family and as for potatoes or wheat they have
none Dr Brother I will quit this subgect and
commence on some thing else you recollect
that your brother Neal was at the Latin
when you left this country I supported
him for 9 years at the Latin school Between
Donegall and Letterkenny at from 8 to
13 ┬ú a year well He passed the examination
for the collage of Maynooth I sent him
there and he was there for 5 years and
he cost me from 15 ┬ú to 40 ┬ú a year
there then came some Debate between
him and one of the Professors of the Collage
and he was sent home after all being lost
by him and wants not be ordained
I had him at home then for 9 months
and I sent him off to America He was
only a few days in New York when he was
sent to collage to a place called Emetsbury
he stoped there for 6 months he
wrote home for the Bishop for to send him
his letters and he neglected in sending them
time after time for Near 2 years he went
off at the 6 month end to Quebec He
stoped there for 3 months he met with
one of the Professors of St Anns Collage
in Lower Canada he went a long
with him there where he remains since
and he is got ordained there so Dr Brother
you may consider what he cost me
for to come trough all that with
him for I had to sell the last cow
that I had in my own name for to
carry him on the for your father threw
the whole Burthen About my Neck at

[[Page 5]]

time And I had to Answer for all I must
Drop that Dr Brother I was near of your
oppinion I did not marry until I got
the whole famly married with the exception
of 3 that is Br Thomas Br Patrick
and Sister Rose Br Pat got married
to one Dorian from the Parish of Dunkane
by Dr Brother I am veary sorry to
explain to you that I would wish he
was unmarried yet for that woman
caused A great Deal of Annoyance in
the town since you father died
she wishes to reighn master in the
town if she could but if course I was
then before her when your father
Died. He left thomas His share of the
Land And they wer both to Live in
the old House And they were to pay
sister Rose Her share off it She had
Rose in that state before 6 months after
His death that she was not fit to brake
through the floor all [[crossed out]] striving to
Banish Her out of the house well for
Save to have peace in the town I
brought Rose to myself and left
her share there with them And Never
got one cent of it she has Brother
thomas in the same state know that
there is only his Madam there so I
think I must take him allso the reason
that those 2 is a burthen to
a man Neither of them is keen
enough for to do for themselves
so you may consider what kind of
a lady Dorian is Dr Brother I have
got no family with the exception of
one child belonging to Br Peter
that I took with me when her mother
died she left 6 small children behind
Her he is got married to a second
wife and has second family brothers
and sisters all says that the
will go to you if they were able to
but the misery is that there is
I think that none of them will be

[[Page 6]]

able to go unless the are assited to go the
all have pretty large familys for to bring
with them if a man has lands here he may
leave it there behind him for he will not
get a man to give him one penny for it
the taxes is so High but I for one do intend
to go to you if you incourage me
and I think I am what would fit you for
I am well Experience in the farming business
Dr brother when I got rid of brother Neals
trouble in the beginning of the bad times
it was foolish enoug to take and purchase
your uncle peters farm of land Along with
what land I had my self at dear rate and
the rent and taxes of the lands is fit to break
Any man here at Present but I thought
at that time that the distress and mistery
of Ireland would not last so long
your brother Andy wishes to know if he was to go
is there coal to be got handy there also
smith tools but I think he will scarcely
go for he has a good farm at Home onlyfor
the great taxes he has to pay Peter He
says he would go if he was able to go there
sister Nabla also if the were Able
And in short the all say the will go But
I think that the Best Plan is if you were
to come to Ireland and such as you
thought it would fit them to go for to
bring them and such as it would not
let them stop at home you will write
to me as soon as this comes to Hand and
you will let me know what part of the
world that country is in or whether
it is woods or not and what cause
or direction we would have to take
going there or is there any sea ports convenient
But if you intend to come
I need not be starting you any Questions
about that you will answer this
as soon as it comes to Hand And you
will direct your Letter to James
Campbell of Drimcoe in county of
Donegall Parish of Inner Near that

Dr Brother I take this opportunity
of writing those few lines to you Hoping
to find you in good Health as this
leaves us all at present thank god
for all His mercies to us Dr Brother
I received A long wished for letter from
you on the 20th of November last
Dated the 8th of october which I was
glad to hear from you not Having
any account from you for 13 years
and 6 months I answered that letter
in A few days after And I got no answer
since that which I am Anxiously waiting
for Dr Brother I Have to inform you
that there is a great many changes in
this country since you left it and
all of them for the worse the loss
of the potatoe crop has caused a great
Desolation in this country those 4 years
past Before those times came on the
lands was out of lease and the land
lords raised the rents and the poor rates
would be rent enough for the land at
the present Day according to the crops
that are coming of the land then Any
tenant geting Back in the rent or rates
the land lords and Agent will tumble
Down their House and [[crossed out]] throw
them and their family into the poor
House for to starve in Hundreds of
Thougsands there was strong farmers
in this country when you left this
that is [[law?]] enough at this present day

[[Page 4]]

I my self was foolish enough to purchase
another farm of land in the beginning of
the bad times that was uncle Peter land
at a Dear rate And what made me purchase
it was for fear of meeting with a Bad Neighbour
And the rents and taxes of so much
land Has Destroyed me alltogether. But
I expected that the failure of the crop
would not continue so long for the taxes
at this present Day would Be two High rent
for any land in this country Dr Brother
I have to inform you that your mother
is Dead this 13 years and rose allso your
father is Dead 3 years first of May uncle Peter
allso in the same month Br Michael
in June after them Brother Peters wife
also is Dead and he has got married
Again He has a second family He had
6 of a family by the first wife But I
Had to take one of the small children to
my self Dr Brother I had Better let
you know some of the Deficultys that
I met with since you left this country
you recollect that Brother Neal was
at the Latin at the time you left this
I left Him at Latin in Donegall And Letterkenny
for 9 years from 5┬ú to 13┬ú a year
it cost me then. He passed examinations
for the collage of May north I sent Him
there for 5 years which cost me 20┬ú a
year then He had some dispute with
one of the professors of the collage He
was then turned out and sent Home
after all Being lost By Him I had then
to send Him off to America and he was
admited in to collage there in a few Days
after he landed there in a place called
Emits Burg He stoped there for 6 months
and our Bishop Neglected to send him
His letters in that time He left that collage
and He went off then to Quebec and

[[Page 5]]

he got in there to a collage in Lower Canada
And he remains there in a collage called
St Anns I Believe he has got ordained
there and he is to remain in until
July Next so I had to sell my last
cow for to carry him through all those
Deficultys sooner than to drop him after
Looseing so much by him for there was
some in the country would be glad that
I would have to drop him after looseing
all By him so you may judge my
situation Now by the bad times coming
on after all this far your father threw
all the burthen about my Neck from
you left this until he Died and I must
say until this Present Day for I did
not change my life until a few years
ago and I done for the whole of the family
with the exception of 2 of them and
I Have to take the charge of them Now
since your fathers Death Brother Pat
married a woman about 8 years ago
the lived in the House with your father
until he Died Brother Thomas sister Rose
allso stayed there But as soon as he was
gone peace was over she began to take
off her shoes and there was no more peace
here your sister Rose had to [[unclear]] then
she would not have her there no time
I had to take her to my self to make
Peace and her  was there and she
would not give her any living in the
House then for to have peace I brought
her with me and since brother Thomas
has the same life with her she has
him run to a skeleton all with bad
tongue so she would confuse the
Parish of Inver if the had any
correspondence with Her for there
was not one Days peace in the family

[[Page 6]]

Since they met with her so I must take
Thomas to my self allso for he will not be
able to live there with her and their [[unclear]]

able to reach your length but they are not

get a handfull of money for it But
Now if a man is leaving his Place he

Dr Brother I take this opportunity
of writing those few lines to you
hoping they will find you in
good health as this leaves us all friends
with the exception of my self at
present thank god for all His mercies
to us I have got an old Heart
some time Ago that Does renew with
me in this season of the year all
ways But thank god I am in
the way of recovering of it at
present Dr Brother I received
your letter a few Days ago Dated
28th of January which I was anxiously
waiting for and I am vary
happy to hear of you enjoying
good health Dr Brother your wish
to know if I intend going to that
country this year I cannot make
certain to you whether I will
go this year or not in this letter
until I see how the crops will
offer for this season for if the
potatoes would come on again
a man would get some thing for
his property and if not he will
get nothing for it and a man
Does think it a poor spite to say
that He will have to leave his
place to any man for Nothing

[[Page 4]]

for if the crops was to come back
I have a neat place and I would
get a Handsome reward for it
but at this present time I would
get nothing for it I hold the one
half of the old farm and allso uncle
Peters farm it is the poor rates
that is cutting Down the farmers
of Ireland alltogether for the have
nothing for that but I hope that
they will soon get lower for them
is not many in the Poor house at
present Dr brother this is the 4th
letter that I have wrote to you
and I hope when this comes to hand
that you will Answer it as quick
as possible and that you will let
me know what kind of a Climate
you have there whether it is veary
hot or veary cold for some people in this
country takes on them to say that
it is a veary hot climate there and
when I receive your answer I will
be able to let you know whether
I will be prepared for this fall
or not I will let you know some
thing about brother Thomas and sister
Rose the are both quite stupid for
the art of man would not make
them as cute as another but they
are both the sturdayest of the whole

[[Page 5]]

family but the are both good strong
slaves only to keep them in human
and some person to be with them
that would show them what to do
and keep them at their work and not
let them neglect their business for
they are both neglectfull if not
watched and kept to their business
you will let me know is that a
woody place or is it well inhabited
or not or how for it might be
from a seaport you will let me
know if you have to keep many
servants or not or how you can
attend so many cattle as you have
on hand or do you milk them or
not Dr Br if the times does not
mend here shortly all your brothers
and sisters would wish to be there
if they were able to go but they all
have a large family to take with
them and they would not be able
to go with out some help but
if I would get anything worth for
my place my family is not
large I think I would nearly be
able for to go but when you are
abler this I will let you know
what I will Do for I will strive
to put Down a large crop this year
that will draw me some money

[[Page 6]]

if I dispose of it you will let me know
if there is conveniency of clergy there
or are the Irish men that lives there
or Black or what persuasion have
they there you will let me know
what kind of labour the carry on
there or farming or is it the same
that they have here if I think of
going this fall if I want any help
for to bring brother Thomas or sister
Rose I will be in time enough
to let you know in the next
letter when I get your answer
to this and I think that brother
Peter would wish to send some of
his first family with us allso if
he was fit for to send them
but I must think it will cost
a great Deal of money for to bring
a family there and to fit them
out for it in every thing they
want I would wish that thomas
and rose was with you at present
for him and his mistress does not
agree well but rose is at no loss
for she lives with me and geting
all sort of justice you will
direct to James Campbell of
Drimcoe Near Mt Charles county
of Donegall in Ireland I am

St. AnnΓÇÖs College 10th June 1850

My Dear Brother
Some months since I had a letter from my brother James
stating that you are still in the land of the living. Before my leaving home nearly six
years since, the contrary was generally believed, but I must say that I set out in the confident
speculation of meeting with you in the stranger land; even this idea had hold of
me for a long time after arriving in New York, though even there I was told you must
be dead, yet I hoped, but in vain. I did, indeed, meet with men who told me they
saw you at such a time at such a place &c. &c. so that I was at last forced to figure
you, to myself, in the character of a Flying Dutchman.

Our brother JamesΓÇÖ letter has however settled my doubts by telling me that
they had a letter from you at home, he tells me too that he wrote to you when he wrote to
me & told you where I was, I would then have written long since, but that I expected
a few lines from you every moment since the receipt of his letter. I begin to fear you
have not received his, as I cannot otherwise imagine why you would not write to me
were it only to give me the safest direction of a letter to you. But perhaps that
philosophy which kept you 13 or 14 years from writing home, has still possession of
your mind as regards me, I should be xtremely sorry that such were the case as in no
circumstances can I admire the silent neglect of all that an Irishman can hold most dear,
viz. our parents while alive, & our old homes while we ourselves live. So for myself, perhaps
so few ever came to America so helpless as I did, & [[know?]] you may imagine that I had many
difficulties to contend with before I could place myself where I now am, and of course in
these times of doubt & difficulty I had no great inclination to let my friends know how I
was situated, still I wrote to them regularly ΓÇô in fact I have never been so long without sending
home a letter as since my brothersΓÇÖ last, & this because I expected a few lines from you.
I cannot however delay longer, so that I post one for home, when I shall post this, but
I hope to have a letter from you soon, were there only a very few lines.

My Dear John I very clearly recollect the day on which you left home, thoΓÇÖ I was
I believe quite little at the time. Our beloved parents were there living, of course you are
aware that both are now dead, Mother died in the December of 1837, Father in the May
of 1847. Uncle Peter is also dead, I believe in the same month & year as father,
Our uncle John is still I believe in the coast-guard service, his daughter Rose is living
near Ballyshannon, Catherine is at a place called Cold Spring on the Hudson, her husbands
name is Doyle from Kingston near Dublin; Annabella & Anne came out about 4 years
since, poor Annabella died about a year after her arrival, Anne still lives in Brooklyn
uncle MichaelΓÇÖs daughter Catherine is married in Brooklyn, her husbands name is McGonagle
I went up to New York about 3 years since. I at that time heard that you were
in Havanna, I wrote thither but could get no account of you, thus I gave up the chase
until I should have my studies finished, when I should have made a strict search, but
JamesΓÇÖ letter put a stop to that & gratified my most ardent wish, viz. to know that
you were alive & well.

I have no time just now to give you a full account of my own life
since we parted, but it was sufficiently checkered, & sometimes full of pain & regret. I do
not recollect whether I was at the Latin when you left or not, but I began it, & during the
time I was at it I felt that I gave all great pain, somehow or other I could [[unclear]] nothing
right at home; I felt that I was often treated harshly, & thus I became indifferent: however
I was sent to Letterkenny, and after a year there I entered the college of Maynooth near
Dublin. Here I got on well until the second year when I had, or rather my class had a
dispute with the Professor & superiors, from my position in the class I was supposed
the ringleader & consequently had to bear this united wrath, I could have done so but
I found that they had set spies on my back, every act & word was distorted into disrespect
& carried to the superiors, when I found such to be the case I treated the spies
& all connected with them with that contempt they so well merited. Then came the time
to take the oath of Allegiance to the British monarch, without this oath I could not
be ordained there, I refused to take the oath, and after near 5 years in the college
I left there, having a promise from my Bishop to continue my studies in France.

You can hardly conceive what my feelings were on my way home even with this
promise; but had I known then all I knew about two or 3 months after I would not
I think have turned towards home, thoΓÇÖ my reception was kind in the circumstances.
Still there was a something often shewing that I was in the way; I remained thus about
the space of 18 months and my every effort was counteracted by hidden enemies.
I at length resolved on emigrating or remaining no longer at home; I left home on
the 30th September of 1844 ΓÇô sailed from Liverpool on the 12th october; landed at
New York on 12th Nov. of same year, & landed as most persons do in that city; I ad
not the address of one single friend ΓÇô I knew many students from Maynooth
were priests in the state of New York, but where to look for them, was the question
which I could not answer.

[[Page 4]]

I remained in New York & Brooklyn about 3 months, during this time I met many
steadfast & true friends; I did all I could to enter the college at New York, but at that season
I could not succeed; I then proceeded, by the kind aid of friends in New York, to Maryland
to a college near Emmetsburg. I remained there until O Connell made his celebrated
speech against slavery ΓÇô this kindled a bad spirit in the students who were generally
from slave states & they attempted to burn O Connell in effigy; I alone undertook
to prevent them, & did so effectually, thoΓÇÖ I did not coincide with O Connel at that
time, nor for some time before I left home. I thought he should rather attend to
his own & his countryΓÇÖs slavery rather than come to attack slavery in America
where his ideas of slavery were despised, & where slaves are in condition superior to
to the farmers of Ireland. But this is nothing to the purpose. Patricks day succeeded
this ΓÇô our society would not be permitted to meet & prohibited by the President of
the college himself an Irishman. Henceforward I would do nothing but what I was
bound to do by the strict rules of the college. I left there in the month of May or
June ΓÇô when I came back to New York, I met Bishop Quarters, he advised me
to come to Canada, and that after a years study in Montreal he would receive me
for his Diocese. When I came to Montreal, I would not be received in the college without
letters when I then had not; I came to Quebec, & remained a year in Quebec, after that year
I entered this college. Thus you see I have  rambled as well as yourself, but I never
left my friends in doubt of my existence or place of abode. It is a Philosophy I like
not, and hence I write to you, thoΓÇÖ in doubt about your address. The map of Texas
has aided me more in finding your address than my brothers letter, and if his
got it, thoΓÇÖ only a student here, having my education & together with $50 P year
for teaching Latin & English, still I contrive to send home a few pounds a year.
At the end of each of the last two years I got part of ordination, at the end of
this year, that is in the month of August, I believe I shall get subdeaconship, and
perhaps Priesthood also, but I have no certainty of the latter so soon.

I had to stop writing yesterday as the alarm of fire was given in the college
The college is situated about 75 miles below Quebec on the banks of the St. Lawrence
with perhaps 30 houses in the village. I must cease as the Post is about to start ΓÇô
our vacation will commence on about the 25th of July ΓÇô you will know
by the time that this note will be on the way, whether your answer will find
me here or not. If you have this before the first of July & write immediately

Mr. Campbell

Dr. Sir,

I received your esteemed
favor of the 15th June, & the enclosed letter for
you to my care, by the mail to-day.

I leave in the morning for Galveston &
for the North if my health will allow of
my traveling & it is uncertain when I
may return. my hand & arm continue
to grow worse & I have not been out since
I last wrote you. The rest of the family
are well & we have a son born on the
5th June & called for me Anson. Business
is very good at Washington. I believe
& there will be a good deal of work to be
done there in you line this fall. My
crops are fine. I sold ΓÇ£JakeΓÇ¥ the yellow boy
you recollect to have seen, to T. J. Allcorn,
last week for $800. If convenient & the crop
of cotton continues to do well I should

[[Page 2]]

like to get Cesareo to help in picking
if you can bring or send him in. The
season is late with us as with you &
there will not be much cotton to pick
before the 1st Sept.

Please remember me to my
good friends Col. Neill & Lady

I remain
very truly
your friend
(in haste) A. Jones.

Able to make out A living for themselves for I strove
to keep them together as long as I could and there is

[[Page 2]]

nothing for Any one of their sort to do in
this country for any one that used to employ servan
is striving to work within themselves the first thing
that broke Him down was rents and Poor rates His Poor
for the last year was 12 pound rent and all together
my lands stood me three pounds [[unclear]] acre for the last year
that and the loss of the Crops put us all Astray and
I was not Able to meet the landlord this year
and He has served me with A notice by the law
to leave the land Again November next I would
think it to much to even to you to assist us all
to go together and if I could I would not wish to be
making Parties of ourselves but if there was A pare
of us out frist it might be A means to bring
the Remainder the sooner there I have no nmore
to say at Present but when you write Direct your
letter to Mr Peter Campbell of Fanahan Parish of
Inver County Donegall Dear Brother I received
your kind and welcome letter which gave me A
great deal of Pleasure to hear how you got Along
and How you are enjoying good Health stating
to me to make sale of  every thing that
I have and go to taxes but if I had as much
more as I have I suppose all would be too little
for to bring me and my family on account of
the Potatoe crops failing with us in this Country
I dont allow that between stock and crops I
could raise more than between twenty and twenty
four Pounds for lands we wud not leave Anything
on it for a man would get plenty of lands in this

[[Page 3]]

Country for to sit down and pay the rents for it
for the best farm in this Country if it was Proposed
for sale there would not be a man to give any thing
for it unless a few pounds for a gratis to the owner
but I allow when I recive an answer from you now
that it would be rather late in the season for
me to Prepare to go out with my wife and Children
but you know best yourself whether or not but if
I do not go this season god willing I will go the next
for the times appear to be getting worse with us you
wrote to me to let you know about brother Michaels
Children He has left seven Children the most
Part of them all little boys and the eldest of [[them?]]
gets very bad health and their mother and[[missing]]
stops in the one place still striving to hold the little
shilter for them and Passing the times in A very
miserable way your uncle John is in the Coast
guard He stops in a place called the Ross
Point in the County sligo Part of his family
Is in America and the Rest stops at Home with
Him your Brother Andrew stops in the
lands of Munterneese Marching Drincoe and He
is getting Along very well and He Has A very
large family And His wife does not gat good
Health betimes and He does not work much
at his trade for it is gone to the bad as well
as every thing else I have no more to at Present

I entend to do and I am makeing all my arrangement
for it and I enten to deposed one hundret pounds
next fall for pasheds and have as many as
I can to come for I think that the will do well
here and get independent in a fue yarse for I can
a siste them in takeing a starte and if the nese
the same econneme that the have to yose in Irlan
the will get ritch in a fue yarse I entend to bring
brother makels widdow and children to me if the
will come and asist them for I think that the
will be of grate assistents to me with my stock
I am in hopes that brother pat will come
This winter and if so I will be bater abel
To determin how to manege and how to advance I
am making my arangements for next fall to do
all I can and if any of them will come
I will do all I can for them and by that time
I will have my stock a gane and I will want
Help to take care of them and to manege them
For I have to pay for 200 to 300 dollars a yare to a han
To herde for me and then I cannot truste them

[[Page 2]]

out of my site and I am oblidge to be ther all my
time and that was the case of me giving my stock
out on the shares for I had bisnes to tend to and I
was oblidge to lave and now I am paying about
400 dollars a yare to a man to take care of them
I am looking evry male for a leter from brother pat and
I cannot determe what to do on til I here from him
and then I will comence making all the preperetions that
I can and bring as many as I can I think that I can
sel some land this winter and that with what real
money that I have that I will be abel to bring
some ten or fifteen to taxas next fall for taxas
is the beste poore manse county that I ever was in
for a man can make from 400 to 600 hundred dollar
a yare a farming it and can have plenty of stock to
do him and when he takes a starte his stocke increases
so fast that he gats ritch be fore he knowsed it if he
will tak care of theme I ente to deposed the money
with a mertchent and when the land in taxas the
money is ther then redy for there pashes and if the

and if you can advise me see a beter plan than
this i will take it as a grate fave fro you I will

to assiste the balence to come to taxas and setel
to gather if I have now land where the want to
setel I will asiste them to by sum but I think

come to new contry the cant get evrything that want
at wants Dear brother you remark in your leter some

money I can in the cors of one mounth raise about
three or foure hundreds dollars and I think
aboute may that I will be able to spare about
five hundrade for I in tend to use all the eneg

Drimcoe June 21rst 1852

Dr Brother I take the opportunity
of writing those few lines to you
hoping to find you and all friends
enjoying good health as this leaves
us and all friends at present thank
god for all his mercies to us
Dr Brother I received your long
wished for letter a few Days ago
which cost me many the uneasy
mind not hearing from you sooner
I have to inform you that the potatoe
crop was as bad here last year as
ever if not worse for at November
last I had not over 2 barrels of
potatoes in all my ground and the
oats Done badley allso with me
Dr Brother I have been badley treated
by Brother Andrew after you left
here he would not allow me to put
one hoof on the grass the next Day
not would he allow the man that
was in the barn to give me one
days work I did not argue with
him about this I allowed He
would pay the rent of it as he was
taking the possesion so quick of it well
at November would he pay on penny

[[Page 2]]

Dr Brother you wish to have brother
Neals redness of here not one scrape
of a pen from him since you left here
and I wrote 2 letters to him since that
and got no answer at that time he
was in quebec in St Patrick Church
you can let brother Peter know that
I thought it strange that he did not
write to me I could send him a
long letter concerning how his property
was handled I am going to give
you a few out lines of it on the 20th
of September last Andrew came
and ordered me to go and hire men
to cut down the oats I brought 4 men
there He came himself and his son
Dan friel and his wife and that was
all the brought it was all cut that
Day 122 stacks of excellent oats
I allso sent men to saw it and it
was brought to Dans friels garden
it was computed that there was 9 1/2
barrels of potatoes there when the
were dug Andrew and Dan was taking
sack of them During the winter
when the spring of the year came on
the 19th of March Andrew went there and
sold some of them and brought a good
many of them home with him Dan got

[[Page 3]]

only His own half of it Mr risfield insisted
that he should pay it as he was
geting the land and he should not
pay any of it for him Mr risfield
then allowed me to pay it and to hold
the land so I had to pay the rent and
the next day he came with his fleting
to live to the house for fear I should
be holding it and he might not be
afraid for I had no thoughts of holding
it for I thought I was long enough
in Partnership with him for he was
still on for having the advantage
of me allso I had to pay brother Pats rent
and arrears of rent I had to sell the
weighty end of my stock at a very
low rate which if I had them
a few months after I would yet
Double the value for them and after
all that he requested of Mr Risfield
to take Pats part of the land from
me and give it to him and the [[unclear]]
sever Mr Risfield gave him that he
would not for that he never would
split that farm and I think that
not all strange for he wrought
about untill he got his poor brother
inlaws land for nothing that is
Connel [[Mudnays?]] so it is not
easy giving him enough of land

[[Page 4]]

a few of them I Do not know what quantity
but they had a great out cast about the
Division of them Dan took them and
he trashed the oats and sold it and
put that in his pocket on known to him
and Andrew was treatening to bring him
to the bench for so doing when the letters
came to hand and I hear nothing of it
since and the would not give me one
stone of either potatoes or oats for to
help my seed where I had to go to the
market to buy both nor even one
stack of the straw for to thatch the
Barrack of houses that was left to me
you may let Peter know that Andrew
pulled his bed steads and brougt them
home with him and sold the land
Different times from November to
Christmas and I prevent the sale often
but the sold it at last unknown to
me at about 13┬ú and they devided the
money between them [[crossed out]]
[[crossed out]] the man that has the land
is Edward Gallauger Andrew has his
boat and he paid one half years rent and
think the earned that at the fishery
he can bring his cart of potatoes to
Donegall every Saturday now and
sell them now when I must go with
my few poinds of butter for to
buy india meal

there He came himself and his son
Dan friel and his wife and that was
all the brought it was all cut that
Day 122 stacks of excellent oats
I allso sent men to saw it and it
was brought to Dans friels garden
it was computed that there was 9 1/2
barrels of potatoes there when the
were dug Andrew and Dan was taking
sack of them During the winter
when the spring of the year came on
the 19th of March Andrew went there and
sold some of them and brought a good
many of them home with him Dan got

[[Page 3]]

only His own half of it Mr risfield insisted
that he should pay it as he was
geting the land and he should not
pay any of it for him Mr risfield
then allowed me to pay it and to hold
the land so I had to pay the rent and
the next day he came with his fleting
to live to the house for fear I should
be holding it and he might not be
afraid for I had no thoughts of holding
it for I thought I was long enough
in Partnership with him for he was
still on for having the advantage
of me allso I had to pay brother Pats rent
and arrears of rent I had to sell the
weighty end of my stock at a very
low rate which if I had them
a few months after I would yet
Double the value for them and after
all that he requested of Mr Risfield
to take Pats part of the land from
me and give it to him and the [[unclear]]
sever Mr Risfield gave him that he
would not for that he never would
split that farm and I think that
not all strange for he wrought
about untill he got his poor brother
inlaws land for nothing that is
Connel [[Mudnays?]] so it is not
easy giving him enough of land

[[Page 4]]

a few of them I Do not know what quantity
but they had a great out cast about the
Division of them Dan took them and
he trashed the oats and sold it and
put that in his pocket on known to him
and Andrew was treatening to bring him
to the bench for so doing when the letters
came to hand and I hear nothing of it
since and the would not give me one
stone of either potatoes or oats for to
help my seed where I had to go to the
market to buy both nor even one
stack of the straw for to thatch the
Barrack of houses that was left to me
you may let Peter know that Andrew
pulled his bed steads and brougt them
home with him and sold the land
Different times from November to
Christmas and I prevent the sale often
but the sold it at last unknown to
me at about 13┬ú and they devided the
money between them [[crossed out]]
[[crossed out]] the man that has the land
is Edward Gallauger Andrew has his
boat and he paid one half years rent and
think the earned that at the fishery
he can bring his cart of potatoes to
Donegall every Saturday now and
sell them now when I must go with
my few poinds of butter for to
buy india meal

Dr Brother I take this opportunity
of writing those few lines
to you Hoping to find you
and all friends in that country
in good health as this
leaves us all at present
thank god for all his mercies
to us Dr Brother I must
think it veary strange that
you all forgot that you
left any of your brothers
behind yous in Ireland but
thank god that we are all
a live yet it was more than
I expected from yous in you
way going for I thought I
behaved like a brother to you
all according to my abilities
and if I have offended you in
any shape I hope yous will
let me know how I have done
so I never receive a scrape
of a pen from any of yous

[[Page 4]]

since you left here only one
from you and one from brother
Peter when yous arived there and
I wrote 3 answers to yous and
never got one since which
makes me think it veary strange
and many others as well as me
thinks it strange and if it was
nothing but the times being
so distressing on the poor at
the same time and then since
it is strange to me that some
of yous would not wish to
know how I was geting a
long but I often heared it
sayed out of sight out of mind
and I believe it to be the case
Dr Brother I must let you
know what loss and and disappointment
has come my way since yous
left here when yous left
I had to sell out my stock
of young cattle for veary
little for to pay the over
plus rent that came on me

[[Page 5]]

for little or nothing and having
to go to the market for
provision for my famly and
servants wages and could not
have any crops it was hard to
stand that and not able to
stock the lad for to pay any
thing it kept me bear and
busy since and worse than
all when I thought that the worst
was over with me I had a veary
fine cow took sick on
the 4th of February inst and was
dead on the 6 and I have no
means of purchasing one in
her place and a man that has
not some stock those times has
no chance likewise I can let
you know another curious job
I had a house in Killybegeys
given me by my ant when
uncle john came there what
did he do take the house in
his own hands and does not allow
that I have any thing to say to it

[[Page 6]]

so him and his family is the most
unreasonable connection ever I heard
of I will be in expetation where
there are so many of yous when I
happened with so maney mistakes
that yous will let me have the
price of one or 2 cows before may
it will not be much from each of
you I had not one scrape of a
pen from Neal since you left here
an I rote different rimes to him
also I suppose you would wish to know
how the Fenaughan business was
settled it just stands as it was
them that received the price of every
thing holds on as for me I never
got one Penny of it Dr Brother
the markets does appear to be high
this year meal is from 15s to 19s
per cut potatoes from 6d to [[unclear]] per
stone

I have nomore to say at present
but mary and the 2 roseys and
me joins in sending our love
and best respects to you and all
the friends in that country in
the kindes manner I am your
brother James Campbell I hope
you will answer this soon

Dr Brother I take this opportunity
of writing those few lines to you
hoping to find you and all friend
in good health as this leaves us
all at present with the exception
of my self I am in a bad state
of health this long time back by
an old hurt that I got 20 years
ago and it comes with me veary
often but thank god I am on
the way of recovery at present
thank god for his mercies to us all
Dr Brother I must think the
times is veary tiring with yous
in texas when yous cannot
afford time to write to me to let
me know whether yous are dead
or alive for I would wish to hear
from yous often I received 2 letter
from yous in Summer last
and got none since that

[[Page 2]]

I have wrote Different letters
since and got no answer from
any of yous but perhaps I am
not worthy of any of yous writing
to me Dr Brother I have to
inform you that the potatoe
crop was as bad this year as ever
in this country with the blight
Dr Brother I have to inform
you that I hear there will be
bad times in this country on
account of this infernall war
that is yet on for provision
apears to rate veary high in
this country and I hear it will
be scarce allso Dr Brother I
have to inform you that this
county will soon be waste
in a short time for there is a
great rumour of a press to be
on young men for this war
and there is not one young man

[[Page 3]]

in the country that is able to
get to America that is not going
off for fear of this and if a man
only wants a servant boy he cannot
get one for love or money and
case is this that if he does he is
not able to pay the wages on
account of the loss of his crops
Dr Brother I have not much
to say here at present on
accout of writing so often [[missing]]
I hope you will answer
as soon as it comes to hand
Mary and me and the 2 Roseys
Joins in sending our love
And best respects to you and
all brothers and sisters Nephew
and neeces and all friends
in that country I am your
brother until death

[[Unclear]] Drimcoe December 18th 185?

Dr Brother I take this opportunity
of writing those few lines to
you hoping to find you enjoying
good health as this leaves us all
inquiring friends at present
thank god for all his mercies to us
Dr Brother I received your kind
letter a few Days ago stating that
you would pay a number of passages
for some of your friends the
next fall I have made inquiry of
them all about it if the would go
there brother Peter says he will
go if you pay his way there with
all his family and all he would
be able to do himself is to fit
them for the passage for he is
noticed for to quit his place
again May next and he will
get nothing for leaveing it and
the number of his family is 9
brother Micheal widow says that
she would wish you for to send
for 3 or 4 of the oldest of her
family for the first time for

[[Page 4]]

she would think it two weighty for
to bring them all at one time and
I think she would wish to know how
the would like that place before
the would go all there and likewise
it would be hard enough for
her to fit them for the are all
in a Destitute state and I would
consider that sister [[unclear]] might send
some of her family allso if the were
sent for and brother Andrew [[unclear]]
send a few of his family and as
for Brother Pat I do not know
what to say about him he is
talking of going this year but I
think he will not be able to
go if he would do any kind of
justice to me or the 2 dissolate
orphants that was left them with
him he wants to sell his part
of the land and brother thomas
his part allso and for to take all
with him and throw thomas on
the top of me as he done with
sister Rose and to give neither
of them anything of what he was
allowd to give them for the case is
in short that  Mary Dorian will

[[Page 5]]

not allow thomas to go in the one ship
with her for she has that much hatred
to him that she cannot [[unclear]] to see
him walking the floor Dr Brother
[[crossed out]] if he does not go this year
when you are sending for them you
will not leave it in his power
for to sell your fathers land
to any strange man for it would
grive me to the heart to see any
man having my fathers land while
I will live here and if you pay his
way there it will be little enough
for him to leave the land to sister
Rose for what he was allowd to give
her and I am not able to pay
any thing for the land to him and
if you pay his passage he is not
entitled to make sale of it and
if you are sending for brother thomas
do not leave it in their power
the bringing of him there for the
will work some schame to leave
him behind Dr Brother that is all
that I can inform you at present
but you will write to me
immediately and let me know
who you will send for all so as
that the will be preparing for

[[page 6]]

the passage Dr Brother there is no
great prospect of a change for the
better in this country as yet for
the potatoes has failed this year
alltogether and our landlord does
not appear to lour the rents any
thing. And all the land lords of this
country is giving some reduction
with the exception of him Dr
Brother I hope if I stop here and
has the charge of sister Rose that
you will not forget me Neither
for she is not able to work nor
[[want?]] for she is quite stupid for
she cannot do any thing like another
and she is a great able [[unclear]] as you
would see but the Art of man can
not make her cute or smart at all
in any business so I hope that you
will not forget her or me more than
the rest of your friends Dr Brother I
will be anxiously waiting for your
letter for to know what you will
do and if brother Pat does not go
[[crossed out]] this year pay you his way
there and let him have nothing to
do with the sale of the land I have
nothing more to say at present
but my Misses and me joins in sendi

Dear martha I
take the opportunity
of writing you afew lines
hoping those few lines will
find you and wilam Richard
and all friends in good halth
as this laves me in at
present thank god for his
mercy to us all whan I
rote to you last I [[crossed out]] rote
you that we wore under
marching orders but it
was bacause the army
was advancen and we thaught
we ware going to have a
fight but Jackson whiped
tham back and we did
not move for three days
and than we moved camp
abut amile and we are
in camp now and I do not
know whan we will
move again but it will

[[Page 2]]

not be long for it
cold wather and we will be
abliged to go in to winter
quarters but we are [[crossed out]]
looking for afight first but
I do not think it will
come off this winter for
it has sat in to rane and
the rods will be so bad
that [[crossed out]] the will be [[crossed out]]
abliged to stop the have removed
mr dannen and burnsides that
his place and is [[crossed out]] going
to take richmond this winter
but he will have alivlay
time of it and it will
do him good whan he gats
thare for I think it will
brake his harts strings to
gat thare thare will be
saven more taxes ragamants
hear by the tanth of dacamber
and when the will come
and join those three ragms
that is hear the will make

[[Page 3]]

ahole in the yanke lines
and we will make sich a
hole that it will make
the other troops walk throo
tham like ablind dog in mate
house and [[crossed out]] I think that the
will not stand more than
one good whiping befor the
will holdon a nuff and I
think that will not be
hard to do since mr dannam
has been moved for I think
he is hade and sholders over
any ginnarl that the
have and the are shiften
about so much that it
is imposable for tham to
[[crossed out]] succasful in thair
atampts and I hope and pray
that the may not gat
a cross the river bafor the
land in hall for the cause
of many [[crossed out]] man to go to
the peech orchet since the
ware commaned and I hope
the war will be over in soon

[[Page 4]]

So as to go home and
live in pease and plasher
and I think I will be
satifiad to stay at home
without travling any more
for I have got travling anuff
for one time to do me
the balns of my life and
I think that I will not
have any more use for
ahorses for I can walk any number

falling creek virginie

Dear Meartha I take the opertunity
of writing you afew lines hoping those few
lines will find you and boy and all friends
in good halth as this leavs me in at present
thank good for his marcy to us all I have
racaved your kind and walkem latter of
the thirty of January which give me
great plasher to hear from you and all friends
being well freau glasher com in to camp

able to pay you some day for your kindness
I wish I could see you and that sweet boy
it wold give me more plasher than any thing
I know of but I cannot gat to see you now

[[Page 2]]

and you must do the bast you
can I have not much of intrust to write
about but I will try to give you a histrey of
the march from fradrickburge to this camp
we had orders to be rady to start at five o clock
on the moring of the saventeenth of fabery
and we wor wak up at three o clock and the
ground was white with snow and we sterted
and it snowed all day and at night we
camped on the snow and nixt moring the
snow was knee deep and then it sat in to
rien and it reined all day and we had to march
in mud and watter knee deep all day long and
at night ly doun in it to sleep at
night and we don very well for our mass lad
a as and we cariad it on the march and when
we got in to camps we would chap wood and
make up a good fier and keep warm by it
till moorning when we would take up
the lind of march again for the day and we
conteniet this for five days and on the fifth
day we march thrue Richmond and when com
true town the sidwalks was crawed with man
wamen and children all the way till we
crossed the james river and then there was a nother
to wach us in manchaster and we marched
out four miles from town and camped
and lay down that night and when

[[Page 3]]

we got up in the moring
the snow was about three feet deep and still
asnowing and it snowed al day and then
it commanced riening and it was as cold as
the mishchief but you know how cold this
kind of wather is to be camped out without
a tante evin and only blanket and oil cloth
for me have to cary avery thing that we have on
our backs and thair was minay a one that give
out on the march but I stood the march
very wall with the exception of about three
or four blisters on each foot and I did not mind
tham for the war not biger than a doller and
I cap up with the compny all the time
we moved from the first camp and we are now on
the peetersburge railrode at falling creek saving
miles from Richmond and I do not know how
long we will stay but I think that we
don hear because it is the senter between
three points in order of the yanky maps
at natack at either points we will be put
on the railrode and run to the plase to
hold tham in chack till the army can
com their I think that thair will be one more
big battle fought and if we can whip tham
as I have no dout but what we will whip
tham I think it will be the last battle of the
ware

[[Page 4]]

I have been down to see drenry bluff
and if the yankey can pass the
battries that is planted their the will pass
in to aturnity for it is the strongest
fortified place I ever seen in my life and
I think we can whip the yanky from now
till tibs eave and and that comes nether befor
nor after chrismes we ere looking for the
[[illegible]] prisners that was taken at arcansaw
for to be landed hear ever day and Jaf
[[missing]] says he will keep the hear whear the
will be of som sarves to the confadrate states
when you write again lat me know
how you ere gating along in the way of
somthing to eat and ware and you stand in
need of anything sall anything that you
can and dont suffer lat me know how my
[[hores?]] is [[dwooing?]] and if their was mast
anuff to faten pork sant you a book the histry
of the taxes briged and one to uncle John
it gives the name of the kild and
in every battle I do not know whir the
will go safe or not but I hope the will
give my love to mother and hir that I
am much beter than when I laft thair give
my love and last respects to uncle and
cansedie and famly and kiss the baby for me
and then lat him kiss you for me also

[[acnalay?]] the loss of 25 thousent in kild or
wounded beside we twook 10 thousent prisners
sich a whiping as that does sum good for the
have not made no atamp to advance since
that and when the dwo the will gat whiped
at the had of this armay for we dont
think of anything als but to whip
tham and that badly we can whip tham
now three to one and not halp try
and if we can whip tham at vixburge
as I think we will I think it will

[[Page 2]]

be the last big battle of the and
I will be glad to hear of it for I
ame tieret of this life you call a solger
they have ataced vixburge six times and
we drove tham back with great loss
avery time and the ginrl in command
says he can hold it aganst any forse
the yankies can sand a ganst him for
his loss is but small from the fackt
that our forse is in brast works and the
army has to cam upe in frunt of tham
I hope the lord will bliss our land with
a victurey that will leed to a peas and that
soon for you do not know how bad I wont
to see you and that sweet little boy of
yours for I can not sleep at night for dreaming
about you and him and I think I can see
you and when I wake up and find it was
but a dream I do not know what to do and
if I could see you once more it wood
do me more goot then anything in the
world oh of if cold prass you to my
hart how hoping I wold feel but I hope
it will not be long till I can gat

injoy a stay at home now for I am
satisfied with my travils and wiling
to stop of I had chanch to do so

[[Page 3]]

there is alittle stink in the
camfire now it is caused by
mager bann he has took a notions
that he must be shierf of [[godloop?]] Co
and in order to be popler in the co he
thinks he must gat sich man in
offes as he taks a fancy to so we have a
captan that bann can leed by the
nose and he ahs try to elact two fo his
man and got tham bating and the
third said that he was a fried to run
for fear he wood gat beating so bann and
might thought the wood appoint
one of bann pats so bann has said that
thair was not a man in the compeny that
had rapatasion anuff to command the
compeny but one or two but a privit
to put up with what a offser say to
him but I think that we will
nock the apointmant in the had
and I think that bann will miss
the starr of his coler and we will be
as big man as he is I think he is asnake
in the gress I must com to a close by
sanding my love and bast respacts to
